WARNING (XSTRM-20): Output Stream file '/software/cadence/users/user27/Desktop/myFile/DRC/switchBox.gds' already exists. It will be overwritten.
INFO (XSTRM-217): Reading the layer map file, /software/cadence/gpdk045_v_4_0/gpdk045/gpdk045.layermap
INFO (XSTRM-162): You have not used the viaMap option. If the OpenAccess design has native oaVia instances, use the -viaMap option for preserving oaVia instances in a Stream Out - Stream In round trip. Using the -viaMap option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design.  For details on the viaMap option, refer to the "Design Data Translator's Reference" guide for XStream.

INFO (XSTRM-180): You have not used the objectMap option. The design has instance(s) of at least one of following OpenAccess objects: oaBlockage, oaBoundary, oaRow, and oaMarker. Any information about these objects will not be translated into the generated stream file. Use the objectMap option to translate/preserve these objects using XStream. For details on the objectMap option, refer to the "Design Data Translator's Reference" guide for XStream.
WARNING (XSTRM-206): Path length 0.03 at location (3,0) on layer 7 is less than 1/2 of path width 0.12. The path would be written in Stream file as is. To resolve this, fix the reported path in the input design and run the translator again.
